# Bazel uses `-debug-prefix-map` to strip the bazel build directory from the
# paths embedded in debug info. This means the debug info contains _project
# relative_ paths instead of Bazel absolute paths.
#
# However, Xcode sets breakpoints via _project absolute_ paths, which are not
# the paths in the debug info. This lldb setting ensures that _project relative_
# paths are remapped to _project absolute_ paths.
#
# NOTE: In order to use this, add this line to `~/.lldbinit`:
#
#     command source ~/.lldbinit-source-map
cat <<-END > ~/.lldbinit-source-map
