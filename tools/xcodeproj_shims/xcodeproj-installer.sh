# The new build system leaves a subdirectory called XCBuildData in the DerivedData directory which causes incremental build and test attempts to fail at launch time.
# The error message says "Cannot attach to pid." This error seems to happen in the Xcode IDE, not when the project is tested from the xcodebuild command.
# Therefore, we force xcode to use the legacy build system by adding the contents of WorkspaceSettings.xcsettings to the generated project.
