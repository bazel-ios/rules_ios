bazel run vmd cmd [-e,-n,-u,-p] -- echo "hello vm"

This program runs a command in a VM with tart for iOS testing

-n|--name - The name of the VM it will run

-p|--port - [Optional] - a port to forward

-e|--entrypoint - [Optional] The entrypoint to run.
This entrypoint supplements the arvg invocation if provided, you need to do all the work handled here ( like running from .runfiles, untarring --upload, etc 

-u|--upload - [Optional] Upload data to the runner 
Examples of this are a .xctest bundle and xctestrunner python code

-z|--no-ephemeral [Optional] By default the VMs are thrown away, turn that off

Consider this an implementation of rules_ios for now. A segment of this program
can be added to tart directly
e.g https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/issues/150
