Congratulations everyone ðŸŽ‰! 2022 is turning out to be _the_ year of Bazel-iOS.
We've done a ton of amazing work and are accelerating iOS development at scale.
I formally invite you to join us for a day of open community and fun, and low level
iOS build talks. We'll additionally host a number of breakout rooms including:
`rules_ios` roadmap, new-around-here, and more.

The event will be held on September 29th at Square Headquarters, 1455 Market
street, San Francisco, CA from 10:00AM - 6:00PST. Registration and social hour
at 9:00AM. We encorge folks to come IRL and will have remote presenters and
guests. To put it bluntly - we want to share the amazing work we've done with
the world!

This is an _open_ call for talks - _especially for contributors ðŸ˜Š_. Please send
