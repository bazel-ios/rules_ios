# Tink

Tink is a crypto library that makes it easy and safe to use crypto without
having a background in cryptography. Tink provides secure APIs that are easy
to use correctly. It reduces common crypto pitfalls with user-centered design,
careful implementation and code reviews, and extensive testing. You can add
features like encryption, decryption and signing to your application with Tink;
the same library AdMob, Google Pay, the Android Search App and several Google
products also use to secure their applications.

Please visit [our developer site](../README.md) for more information.
