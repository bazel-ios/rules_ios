# Plaid Link for iOS [![version][link-sdk-version]][link-sdk-url]

üì± This repository contains a sample application for [Swift](LinkDemo-Swift) (requiring Xcode 11) that demonstrates integration and use of Plaid Link for iOS.

üìö Detailed instructions on how to integrate with Plaid Link for iOS can be found in our main documentation at [plaid.com/docs/link/ios][link-ios-docs]. For details on how to migrate from LinkKit 1.x to LinkKit 2.x please review the [Link Migration Guide][link-1-2-migration].

1Ô∏è‚É£  The previous major version of LinkKit can be found on the [main-v1][link-main-v1] branch.

## About the LinkDemo Xcode projects

Plaid Link can be used for different use-cases and the sample applications demonstrate how to use Plaid Link for iOS for each use-case.
For clarity between the different use cases each use case specific example showing how to integrate Plaid Link for iOS is implemented in a Swift extension.

Before building and running the sample application replace any Xcode placeholder strings (like `<#GENERATED_LINK_TOKEN#>`) in the code with the appropriate value so that Plaid Link is configured properly. For convenience the Xcode placeholder strings are also marked as compile-time warnings.

Select your desired use-case in [`ViewController.didTapButton`](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios/search?q=didtapbutton) then build and run the demo application to experience the particular Link flow for yourself.
