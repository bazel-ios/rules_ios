# Bazel uses `-debug-prefix-map` to strip the bazel build directory from the

# relative_ paths instead of Bazel absolute paths.
#
# However, Xcode sets breakpoints via _project absolute_ paths, which are not
# the paths in the debug info. This lldb setting ensures that _project relative_
# paths are remapped to _project absolute_ paths.
#
# The platform settings one points the current working directory (cwd) to workspace root.
# This is needed for features relying on lldb remote debugging, such as `oso_prefix_is_pwd`.
